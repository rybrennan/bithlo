# AI Tools Hub

AI Tools Hub is an affiliate marketing website promoting three different AI products with a focus on user-friendly navigation and clear CTAs. The goal is to create a clean, uncluttered, and professional website design that not only highlights each product but also guides visitors through a well-defined sales funnel.

## Website Structure

- **Homepage:** The landing page provides an overview of the website offerings, brief introductions to the AI products, latest reviews, and a clear call-to-action (CTA) to explore products.

- **Product Landing Pages:** There are three individual landing pages, one for each AI product. These pages include detailed product descriptions, features, benefits, pricing, video testimonials, and CTAs. They also promote the other two AI products.

- **About Us Page:** This page provides background information about the website and its mission.

- **Contact Us Page:** This page provides contact details including a contact form, email address, and/or social media links.

- **Blog/News Page:** A blog section for regular posts about AI trends, product updates, or other related topics (optional in the initial phase).

- **Email Subscription:** An option for visitors to subscribe to updates or newsletters.

## Sales Funnel Structure

1. **Awareness:** Visitors learn about the website and the AI products through Facebook ads and organic search.

2. **Interest:** Visitors explore the products via the landing pages, where the product descriptions, features, pricing, and video testimonials help build interest.

3. **Desire:** After exploring, visitors consider purchasing a product, trusting the affiliate recommendations and testimonials.

4. **Action:** Strategically placed CTAs on the product landing pages guide the visitor to click on the affiliate link and make a purchase.

Remember, this design and structure should be user-centric, focusing on the journey of a visitor from the awareness stage to the conversion stage.

## Future Work

This is a continuous and iterative process, and analytics should be used to understand visitor behavior, refine strategies, and optimize the website for better conversion. Also, the website should be structured in a way that allows easy expansion when the own AI product is ready to be launched.
